If you're like me and were disappointed that Google TV's "App Only Mode" omits key apps that are needed to make the mode truly viable, than this is the place for you. 

Instructions:
• Click on the desired shortcut ie: "GooglePlay_shortcut.apk"
• Click "View Raw"
• Sideload to Google TV (just Google "Sideload Google TV")

If you don't trust random apks(smart person) from strangers then you can make your own here:

App Package names are "com.android.vending" for Play Store and "com.google.android.videos" for Movies&TV

You can figure out the rest, you're smart, remember?


TLDR: These two shortcuts allow access to their respective apps while using "App Only Mode" on Google TVs
